## 2026-09-06 — gzclient X11 auth crash on `backend:=gazebo`

**Problem:** `ros2 launch tb3_bringup bringup.launch.py backend:=gazebo
nav:=false` spawned the robot fine (`robot_state_publisher`, `gzserver`,
`spawn_entity` all succeeded — `/cmd_vel`, `/odom` live) but `gzclient`
aborted (SIGABRT) with `Authorization required, but no authorization
protocol specified`.

**Root cause:** Both the `isaacsim` and `tb3_ros` containers run as root,
but the host X server's access control is per-UID (`xhost` shows
`SI:localuser:<user>`, not root). `docker-compose.yml` mounted
`/tmp/.X11-unix` and passed `DISPLAY`, but never gave the container an
Xauthority cookie, so root's X11 clients couldn't authenticate. `gzserver`
only warns and keeps going (it's headless-capable); `gzclient` actually
needs to open a window and aborts without one.

**Fix:** Added `docker/x11-auth.sh` — generates a docker-specific Xauthority
cookie from the host's current `$DISPLAY`, re-keyed under a wildcard family
so it authenticates regardless of the container's hostname. `docker-compose.yml`
now mounts that cookie to `/root/.Xauthority` and sets `XAUTHORITY` for both
services. Run the script once per X session before `docker compose up/run`
(re-run after an X session restart — the cookie rotates on login).

Verified by opening a bare `gzclient` in a fresh container and confirming
its window actually appeared on the host X server (`xwininfo -root -tree`
showed the full Gazebo widget tree, no auth error in the log).

**Also:** updated `docs/troubleshooting.md`'s existing X11 bullet, which
recommended `xhost +local:docker` — that permanently loosens host X access
control instead of scoping a single cookie file, and doesn't get mentioned
again here for that reason.

## 2026-09-06 — Isaac Sim GUI never opened: the container is not root

**Problem:** `docker compose up -d isaacsim` reported `healthy` and the ROS 2
bridge loaded, but no Isaac Sim window ever appeared on the host.

**Root cause:** the previous entry's X11 fix assumed *both* containers run as
root. That is false for `isaacsim`. NVIDIA's `tools/docker/Dockerfile` ends
with `USER isaac-sim` (uid 1234, home `/isaac-sim`), so mounting the Xauthority
cookie at `/root/.Xauthority` put it somewhere uid 1234 cannot even traverse:

    $ docker exec isaacsim ls -la /root/.Xauthority
    ls: cannot access '/root/.Xauthority': Permission denied

Kit does not treat that as fatal. It logs `GLFW initialization failed`,
`failed to open the default display`, `Failed to acquire IWindowing interface`
and `IAppWindow::startup failed`, then runs on windowless. The image's
healthcheck only greps the Kit log for `AppReady`, so `docker ps` still says
`healthy` — the failure is completely silent from the outside.

**Fix:** mount the cookie at `/tmp/.docker.xauth` for the `isaacsim` service
and point `XAUTHORITY` there (`/tmp` is chowned to `isaac-sim` by the image).
`tb3_ros` genuinely does run as root, so it keeps `/root/.Xauthority` — the two
services now mount the same cookie at deliberately different paths, and the
compose comments say why. Verified: uid 1234 can now stat and read all 134
bytes of the cookie, where before it got EACCES.

Also corrected the "both containers run as root" claim in `docs/setup.md`,
`docs/troubleshooting.md` and `docker/x11-auth.sh`'s header, and documented the
healthy-but-windowless symptom so the next person recognises it.

**Concept — silent GUI failure vs. loud one.** `gzclient` aborts with SIGABRT
when it can't authenticate; Kit shrugs and keeps going. Same root cause, but
only one of them tells you. Whenever a GUI container reports healthy and shows
nothing, read the app's own log before touching DISPLAY or xhost.

## 2026-09-06 — Imported TB3 asset had no geometry at all

**Problem:** `tb3_world.usd` opened cleanly in Isaac Sim and rendered nothing.

**Root cause:** the expanded URDF points at its meshes by
`package://turtlebot3_description/meshes/...`, and the isaacsim container has no
ROS installed and therefore no such package anywhere on disk. `import_tb3.py`
never passed `ros_package_paths`, so `urdf_usd_converter` fell back to resolving
each URL as a *bare relative path* against the URDF's own directory
(`/scenes/meshes/bases/burger_base.stl`), found nothing, and emitted the link
anyway — an empty `Xform` carrying the correct transform and material binding
but no geometry. No error, no warning that survived to the console.

What kept this hidden: the inline `<collision>` primitives (`<box>`,
`<cylinder>`) have no external file, so they imported perfectly and the prim
tree looked fully populated. But collision geometry imports with
`purpose = "guide"`, which is not drawn. So the stage had a plausible-looking
hierarchy, correct joints, correct physics — and nothing visible.

Evidence, before vs after:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `geometries.usd` in the asset package | absent | 2.0 MB |
| robot mesh prims | 0 | 4 |
| `burger_base` points | — | 48040 |
| robot subtree bounds | FLT_MAX sentinels (empty) | 138 x 178 x 191 mm |

138 x 178 x 192 mm is the published size of a real Burger, so the fixed asset is
dimensionally right, not merely non-empty.

**Fix:** `docker cp` the `turtlebot3_description` share dir out of the tb3_ros
image onto the shared `isaac/scenes/` mount (gitignored, 40 MB), and pass
`ros_package_paths=[{'name': 'turtlebot3_description', 'path':
'/scenes/turtlebot3_description'}]`. Resolution is `path / relative_path`, so
`path` must be the package directory itself — pointing at its parent fails
identically and just as quietly.

Added `isaac/scripts/verify_asset.py` as a gate: it composes a stage and exits
non-zero when the robot subtree has no renderable geometry. Confirmed it fails
on the old broken asset and passes on the new one, so it isn't vacuous.

**Concept — two traversal traps in one script.** Writing that checker surfaced
both. (1) The importer marks visual meshes `instanceable = true`, so a plain
`Stage.Traverse()` stops at the instance boundary and reports *zero* meshes on a
perfectly good asset; `Usd.PrimRange.Stage(stage, Usd.TraverseInstanceProxies())`
is required. (2) Bounding the whole stage is not a real check, because the
ground plane alone makes it non-empty — the robot subtree has to be bounded on
its own. A validator that gets either wrong is worse than none, since it reports
green on exactly the bug it exists to catch.

**Concept — FLT_MAX as the empty-bounds tell.** USD writes an inverted-infinite
range (`3.4028235e38` min, `-3.4028235e38` max) for geometry it cannot measure.
Seeing that in `extentsHint` is the fastest way to spot a mesh-less asset without
opening the viewport.
